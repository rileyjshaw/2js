# shaderpad

## 1.0.0-alpha.2

### Patch Changes

-   Remove log from save()

## 1.0.0-alpha.1

### Minor Changes

-   Add save() method

    This method saves the current frame to a PNG file. The filename is optional; if not provided, it will be "export.png".

## 1.0.0-alpha.0

### Major Changes

-   Initial alpha release ðŸŽ‰

    Iâ€™ve started using this on a few projects, and Iâ€™m pretty confident that the API will retain this general shape. I want to try adopting ShaderPad into a few more projects before officially moving this out of alpha.

    Always open to suggestions!
